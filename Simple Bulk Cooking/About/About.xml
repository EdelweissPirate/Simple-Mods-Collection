&lt;size=20&gt;Simple Bulk Cooking&lt;/size&gt;

A simple mod that adds bulk cooking recipes of meals and other food products. Cook meals in bulks of 4 to save time when cooking and carrying ingredients.

No research required. Only a higher cooking skill level than the single meal recipe to balance the increased efficiency.
