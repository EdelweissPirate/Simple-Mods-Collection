# Simple Mod Collection
A collection of small mods for Rimworld

## Simple Recycling
A mod that adds recycling of apparel in the same way weapons are smeltable in the core version.

To recycle apparel, research "apparel recycling" and then add the bill to a tailoring workbench.

## Simple Steel Bridges
A mod that adds steel briges on top of the wood bridges that rimworld core provides. Steel briges work the same way, but also provide support for heavy stuctures.

Research "steel bridges" to build them.
