# Simple Mod Collection
A collection of small mods for Rimworld

## Configurable Texture Patch
A selection of different legacy textures. You can choose which textures you want to use in the mod settings menu.

Safe to add or remove to/from existing saves.
No restart or reload required after changing a texture in the settings menu for maximum comfort.

## Plant Growth Sync
This mod adds synchronization of plant groth in growing zones. So it equals little differences when a colonist only sows one part of a zone and then takes a break before finishing the rest or if single plants were eaten by an animal. The growth sync equals this slowly over time so that the whole zone can be harvested at the same time. (Or with larger differences after a few harvests.)

Growth sync only affects crops in your growing zones.

## Simple Bulk Cooking
A mod that adds bulk cooking recipes of meals and other food products. Cook meals in bulks of 4 to save time when cooking and carrying ingredients.

No research required (currently, may change). Only a higher cooking skill level than the single meal recipe to balance the increased efficiency.

## Simple Bulk Drugs
This mod that adds bulk drug production recipes. Produce wake-up, medicine or other drugs in bulk to save time when crafting and carrying ingredients.

No research required (currently, may change). Only higher skill requirements than the single recipes to balance out the increased efficiency.

## Simple Recycling
A mod that adds recycling of apparel in the same way weapons are smeltable in the core version.

To recycle apparel, research "apparel recycling" and then add the bill to a tailoring workbench.

## Simply More Bridges
A simple mod that adds more briges types on top of the wood bridges that rimworld core provides. Heavy briges work the same way as wood ones, but also provide support for heavy stuctures. Deep water bridges can be built in deep water.
You can build these new bridges out of steel, plasteel and stone types.

Research "heavy bridges" and "deep water bridges" to build them.

## Simple Stockpile Presets
A mod that adds various presets for stockpile settings in a comfortable float menu. You can use them to easily set often used storage configurations, both generic ones (like freezer stuff) and specific ones (like food, drugs, weapons or clean apparel).

This is a QOL mod, no content added or changed. To use it, just make a stockpile and select a preset.

## Single Plant Textures Patch
A small patch that changes the textures of rice and haygrass to single plants. This gives a cleaner look and a small performance increase.

## Small Maps
This mod adds more smaller map sizes. Small maps mean less resources, less building space and less time to react to raids which increases your overall game difficulty.
Furthermore smaller maps increase the games performance by a significant part.

Can safely be added or removed to existing saves. New map sizes are 100, 125, 150 and 175.
