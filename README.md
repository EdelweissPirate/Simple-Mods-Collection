# Simple Mod Collection
A collection of small mods for Rimworld

## Simple Bulk Cooking
A mod that adds bulk cooking recipes of meals and other food products. Cook meals in bulks of 4 to save time when cooking and carrying ingredients.

No research required (currently, may change). Only a higher cooking skill level than the single meal recipe to balance the increased efficiency.

## Simple Bulk Drugs
This mod that adds bulk drug production recipes. Produce wake-up, medicine or other drugs in bulk to save time when crafting and carrying ingredients.

No research required (currently, may change). Only higher skill requirements than the single recipes to balance out the increased efficiency.

## Simple Recycling
A mod that adds recycling of apparel in the same way weapons are smeltable in the core version.

To recycle apparel, research "apparel recycling" and then add the bill to a tailoring workbench.

## Simple Steel Bridges
A mod that adds steel briges on top of the wood bridges that rimworld core provides. Steel briges work the same way, but also provide support for heavy stuctures.

Research "steel bridges" to build them.
